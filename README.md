# Introduction to Data Science Group Project - Summer 2024

### This project aims to use machine learning to make book rating predictions using features like author, page count, average rating, and price. The data used in this project is from the [Amazon Books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews?select=books_data.csv) dataset on Kaggle.


### Use Case 

Imagine a website where users can purchase books and leave reviews of those books. It's plausible users might find book rating recommendations useful after writing their review. Imagine a modal that displays text like 'Is 4 out of 5 stars accurate?'.

</p>

If the user's feeling toward the book agreed with this rating, they could click yes. Otherwise, they could click no and modify the rating to reflect their true opinion of the book. Attributes like the book's price, number of ratings, page count, and sentiment of the user's review could be used to predict the book rating. This feature would make leaving reviews more effortless because the user would(ideally) have to enter less information since their book rating would be prefilled. A more seamless review experience may lead to more reviews being left on the website, which could be advantageous for the business. It's reasonable to think people are more likely to buy from a business with ample reviews of their products compared to a business with limited or no user reviews.

### Project Structure 

We consolidated the code for each of the data science lifecycle stages into Jupyter notebooks.
